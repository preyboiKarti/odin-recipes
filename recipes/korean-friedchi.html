    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Korean fried chicken (or KFC as those in the know call it) differs vastly from American-style fried chicken. Rather than the craggly, crusty, significant coating you'd get on say, a Chick-Fil-A sandwich or a Popeye's drumstick, you get an eggshell-thin, ultra-crisp crust around a drippingly juicy interior.</p>
    <p>Finger-licking good, Korean-style hot wings made easy and simple. The sauce can be made up to two weeks ahead of time; flavor will intensify.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha) (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Asian (toasted) sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 quart peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, barbeque sauce, garlic, vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, pepper, sesame oil, and ginger together in a saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl; stir into sauce. Remove from heat and set aside to cool and thicken.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season chicken wings with lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
        <li>Fry chicken wings in batches of 6 to 8 at a time in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meatiest part of the wing, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place cooked wings into a large mixing bowl. Ladle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
